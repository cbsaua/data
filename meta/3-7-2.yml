SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>Target 3.7: By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive
  health-care services, including for family planning, information and
  education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies
  and programmes</p>

  <p>Indicator is linked to Target 5.6 (Ensure universal access to sexual and
  reproductive health and reproductive rights as agreed in accordance with the
  Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and
  Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of
  their review conferences) because reductions in adolescent childbearing that
  are brought about by increasing access to sexual and reproductive health-care
  services are also reflective of improvements in sexual and reproductive health
  and the exercise of reproductive rights per se. This indicator is linked to
  Target 17.19 (By 2030 build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of
  progress on sustainable development that complement gross domestic product and
  support statistical capacity-building in</p>

  <p>developing countries) because the estimates of the adolescent birth rate
  are based in part on birth registration and census data. Strengthened civil
  registration and vital statistics systems reaching universal coverage of birth
  registration and conducting at least one census every 10 years are directly
  relevant for measuring progress on target 3.7.</p>
